<h1>Principle</h1>
<p>The Minidome or Portable Light Dome is an automated 3D digitizing solution, developed by the computer vision group <a href="http://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi/visics"><b><span style="color:#ffbb88">VISICS</b></span></a> at KULeuven.
</p>

<p>
It consists of a small, light-weight dome of light
sources and a digital camera. It can carry both SLR cameras as machine vision cameras.
The approach is geared towards an easy-to-use, relatively inexpensive solution
for virtually inspection of objects, where both the 2D aspect ( color, intensity, or other representations
through filtering and relighting) as well as the 2D+/3D aspect ( by estimating the 3D surface characteristics
are being considered. The <a href="specs.php"><span style="color:yellow">results</span></a> allow for photorealistic virtual re-lighting and non-photorealistic 
rendering of the objects in real-time through the use of programmable graphics hardware. </p>

<p>For portability, the device is built out of 4 identical parts, and is quickly deployable on-site. It
allows a wide range of object sizes, with an easy calibration procedure one can switch easily between both macro as well as wide-angle digitization </p>

The Minidome provides a flexible, cost effective alternative to the traditional scanning approach. 
And whereas the traditional techniques focus mainly on the 3D surface properties, a surface is not only characterized by it's 3D nature, but equally by it's color, reflectance properties, albedo, BRDF,.. The minidome is designed to deliver results on both sides, while at the same time optimizing ease of use and flexibility.
</p>
<p>The current portable dome has a radius of 60~cm and is a discrete illumination hemisphere consisting of 260
white power LEDs positioned both on the knots and in the center of the edges. The LEDs are 5W Lambertian
emitters (over a 120\degree angle), resulting in homogeneous illumination. 
Each LED can be individually lit and the corresponding images can be
recorded by the camera mounted on top. The entire recording procedure is programmable and fully
automatic.</p>
